# Keyboard Browsing

For keyboard centric users one of the main problems is browsing efficiently. 

This is very easy in editors like Vim but what in other programs?

## Browsers

In the case of web browsers there are a couple of very useful navigation keybindings.

* Tab for tabbing through links. Press Enter to open, C-Enter to open in new tab.
* Space and Page Down both have same function. S-Space and Page Up too.
* A context menu can be opened with the 'book' symbol, close to the windows key. 
(not all kb have this). Same effect is achieved with S-F10.
* F6 moves us between address bar and page.
* The address bar can be focussed with C-l too.
* Alt usually enables many other functions. Example, Alt-f opens the 
File tab in firefox. Alt-'underline letter' opens the respective tab. This works in Openbox WM.
