# COMMAND LINE   
I'm listing here not only shortcurs but also some neat tools to release the tension in your neck.
## Syntaxis      
Modifiers are special keys that we list below.   
After a modifier a dash (-) is added.       
   
C =  Ctrl   
A = Alt   
S = shift   

C-l: clear terminal. Typing clear works the same.   
## motions   
C-a: beginning of line   
C-e: EoL   
## deletions   
C-k: all after cursor.   
C-u: all before cursor (C-e C-u removes all the line). 
   
## Callings with exclamation point   
![history_ID]: executes the command with that ID (get the ID running history on CLI)   
!name: runs last execution of program named 'name'   
!!: replaces !! with last command.   
useful cd !!, sudo !!   
   
## Get Help   
aproposal (for installing)
